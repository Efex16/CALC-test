[Lyrics For Learning](http://lyricsforlearning.net/) is a web application aimed at helping students practice their English language skills through music. Upon visiting the site, you can select a popular song and explore the meaning of words within the lyrics. Specifically, you can check out a linguistic breakdown of each word and share what you think the word means within the context of the song.

Visual Studio Code vs Android Studio ‚Äì Functionality, Search and Source Control
Visual Studio Code vs Android Studio ‚Äì Functionality, Search and Source Control
Mar 17, 2020

When it comes to the tools we use to develop our Flutter apps, there are two main contenders. It usually boils down to either Visual Studio Code or Android Studio. In this article, Lewis Cianci compares these two tools in three key areas.

Years ago, there weren‚Äôt many choices when it came to Integrated Development Environments (IDE). In the early days, there were languages like Visual Basic 6 which had to be written in Visual Studio and that was it.

Nowadays, we have choices to make, not only related to what languages and frameworks we use to make our apps, but also the tooling that we use to accomplish this task. This topic is somewhat surprisingly hotly contested, with people avidly defending ‚Äútheir‚Äù IDE and plugins over another IDE.


‚öô Functionality: How easy is it is to get around my code? Can I tear tabs off and work on my code with more than one window open at a time?
üîéSearch: Is it straightforward to find where a certain widget has been used in my app? If I forget the implementation of something, can I easily search and find if it has been used somewhere else?
üë©‚Äçüíª Source control: Does the source control solution make it easy to see changes and differences?
Functionality
Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code is an editor that favors simplicity over having an endless assortment of bells and whistles. Most of the functionality is exposed by typing in the thing you need into the top search bar.

Visual Studio Code

Everything you would expect to be there is there: debugging, breakpoints, etc.

However, something that I have been doing for years in every IDE that I have used is to tearing off the tabs from the top. This is invaluable, as at various times I can effectively work on two parts of my app at the same time.

Visual Studio Code can‚Äôt do this and it doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs getting this functionality any time soon. You can split your tabs so that one window is split down the middle or you can try to reopen the same project in another instance of Visual Studio Code. But you can‚Äôt just tear the tabs off.

The practical effect of this is that if you are working between your services and your UI layer, you have to switch back and forth between both files until you eventually solve the issue.

Android Studio
Android Studio is more of a ‚Äúkitchen sink‚Äù approach to an IDE. Google licensed IntelliJ IDEA and used it to make Android Studio. Software developers have been using it to make apps for Android for a very long time.

In terms of tearing the tabs off: Well, you just do it. You just pick one up, drag it off, and you‚Äôre done. You can put these onto alternate screens ‚Äì whatever you want. Any comparable solution to doing this in Visual Studio Code (that‚Äôs as easy as just grabbing the tab and moving it to where you want it) doesn‚Äôt seem to exist, at least not at the time of writing.

For me personally, this is enough to make me want to use Android Studio by itself, but let‚Äôs press on.

Searching in the project
Visual Studio Code
Visual Studio Code has the ability to ‚Äúsearch anywhere‚Äù in the project when the user presses CTRL+SHIFT+F. Search anywhere

As we can see, I‚Äôve searched for Sonder, and on the left-hand side of this window we have all the results. You can move backwards and forwards through them with F4 and SHIFT+F4. It‚Äôs certainly functional.

The only gripe I have with this search feature is that you tend to lose a lot of context when searching. We‚Äôre restricted to looking at each and every result of our search here, either by clicking on a specific result or using hotkeys to move through them. Afterwards, we can get back to where we were by clicking on the appropriate tab up at the top or hitting ALT+LEFT ARROW until we get back to where we were. Sometimes when I do that, I forget where I was up to and what I was doing initially.

Android Studio
Again, CTRL+SHIFT+F. But this time, we get a dedicated search dialog. It looks like this:

Search dialog

If we search for something, like Sonder, we get the results in this dialog:

Search results

Pressing the up or down cursors here will show us results from that particular file, as well as the 8‚Äì9 lines on either side of that search result. Search results

Sometimes, I‚Äôm searching for an implementation of a certain widget or function, and then I just quickly hit CTRL+SHIFT+F to bring up this dialog. Doing so, I can quickly move through the list by using the up and down arrows, and when I have found what I‚Äôm looking for, I can just hit escape to go back to the file I was working on initially. In terms of productivity, I find this is more powerful and faster.


To start using this web application, visit lyricsforlearning.net. To install it, simply clone this repository. You can start the app by running `web_app.app` and `api.v1.app` as Python modules in separate terminal windows. Please note, in order to run this app, you will need to install necessary dependencies as well as pass in the correct MySQLdb and Words API credentials respectively.

## Challenge

- This portfolio is targetted at solving and making it easy for calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA) by only administrative authorized person.

- This portfolio will not solve the issue of inputting the calculated GPA into a database for documentation. it's basically for calculating GPA.

- This portfolio is targetted on academic administrative staffs who are sattled with the responsibility of calulating departmental GPA of students before final inputation into the school database.

- This project is relevant to higher institution setting, both the institutionS scaling on 4.00 GPA and 5.00 GPA.

## Risks

I built an internal RESTful API for this web application so that data can be flexibly retreived from the MySQLdb. All available endpoints can be found in the `api.v1.views` directory. Here's a description of each endpoint:
     
## Infrastructure

Beyond this initial MVP which was built in 2 weeks, I would like to continue to add many more features to Lyrics For Learning. In particular, I would like to setup an authentication system. With this, I would also like to enable users to have profiles so they can check out their past progress and further personalize the experience by suggesting songs and words to explore based on past use. In addition, I'd like to allow users to edit past submissions and upvote each other's interpretations as well. I am also considering adding a "Top Users" board on the homepage too.

If you have any feedback (ex: feature ideas) or would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to contact me.

## Future

- In expanding the functionality of the portfolio, i intend to integrate a student log-in where student can only have access to their GPA score. 

- I intend in integrating a link for the output of the portfolio to be an input to the school result database.
