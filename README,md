[Lyrics For Learning](http://lyricsforlearning.net/) is a web application aimed at helping students practice their English language skills through music. Upon visiting the site, you can select a popular song and explore the meaning of words within the lyrics. Specifically, you can check out a linguistic breakdown of each word and share what you think the word means within the context of the song.

### Tools

- Android Studio

### Programming Language

- Java

### List of libraries

- https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/androidx-rn



To start using this web application, visit lyricsforlearning.net. To install it, simply clone this repository. You can start the app by running `web_app.app` and `api.v1.app` as Python modules in separate terminal windows. Please note, in order to run this app, you will need to install necessary dependencies as well as pass in the correct MySQLdb and Words API credentials respectively.

## Challenge

- This portfolio is targetted at solving and making it easy for calculation of Grade Point Average (GPA) by only administrative authorized person.

- This portfolio will not solve the issue of inputting the calculated GPA into a database for documentation. it's basically for calculating GPA.

- This portfolio is targetted on academic administrative staffs who are sattled with the responsibility of calulating departmental GPA of students before final inputation into the school database.

- This project is relevant to higher institution setting, both the institutionS scaling on 4.00 GPA and 5.00 GPA.

## Risks

I built an internal RESTful API for this web application so that data can be flexibly retreived from the MySQLdb. All available endpoints can be found in the `api.v1.views` directory. Here's a description of each endpoint:
     
## Infrastructure

Beyond this initial MVP which was built in 2 weeks, I would like to continue to add many more features to Lyrics For Learning. In particular, I would like to setup an authentication system. With this, I would also like to enable users to have profiles so they can check out their past progress and further personalize the experience by suggesting songs and words to explore based on past use. In addition, I'd like to allow users to edit past submissions and upvote each other's interpretations as well. I am also considering adding a "Top Users" board on the homepage too.

If you have any feedback (ex: feature ideas) or would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to contact me.

## Future

- In expanding the functionality of the portfolio, i intend to integrate a student log-in where student can only have access to their GPA score. 

- I intend in integrating a link for the output of the portfolio to be an input to the school result database.
