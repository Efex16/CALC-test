[Lyrics For Learning](http://lyricsforlearning.net/) is a web application aimed at helping students practice their English language skills through music. Upon visiting the site, you can select a popular song and explore the meaning of words within the lyrics. Specifically, you can check out a linguistic breakdown of each word and share what you think the word means within the context of the song.

## GP_CALC

Before I discovered my passion for software engineering, I was a middle school special educator in Brooklyn, NY. As a teacher, I found that music was such a powerful way to help my students learn language since they all had a natural connection to it and it provided a context for their learning. Drawing from my experiences in the classroom, I was inspired to create Lyrics For Learning.

Initially, Lyrics for Learning was going to solely allow students to check out linguistic breakdowns for words within songs. However, after reflecting upon how I leveraged music in my own classroom and getting feedback from other teachers, I decided to also allow users to share their own interpretations of what words mean within songs. By exploring both the literal and figurative meaning of words in songs they know, students can deepen their understanding of the English language in a context that is familiar to them.

## Technologies

To start using this web application, visit lyricsforlearning.net. To install it, simply clone this repository. You can start the app by running `web_app.app` and `api.v1.app` as Python modules in separate terminal windows. Please note, in order to run this app, you will need to install necessary dependencies as well as pass in the correct MySQLdb and Words API credentials respectively.

## Challenge

## Risks

I built an internal RESTful API for this web application so that data can be flexibly retreived from the MySQLdb. All available endpoints can be found in the `api.v1.views` directory. Here's a description of each endpoint:
     
## Infrastructure

Beyond this initial MVP which was built in 2 weeks, I would like to continue to add many more features to Lyrics For Learning. In particular, I would like to setup an authentication system. With this, I would also like to enable users to have profiles so they can check out their past progress and further personalize the experience by suggesting songs and words to explore based on past use. In addition, I'd like to allow users to edit past submissions and upvote each other's interpretations as well. I am also considering adding a "Top Users" board on the homepage too.

If you have any feedback (ex: feature ideas) or would like to contribute to this project, please feel free to contact me.
